Version 1.2.4:

   Added timeout to configureSocket() in OmsiClient, so that if network
   traffic is heavy, client will give up trying to send file to server,
   and try again.  This way at least Mac users need not fear the dreaded
   "spinning rainbow disk."

   Server now will create a file LOGFILE, recording IP addresses of
   client connection actions.  File is stored in the same directory as
   the student answer files.

Version 1.2.5:

   Cleaned up configureSocket() a bit, putting 'try:' within a 'while'
   loop rather than recursing if error.

   Added this CHANGELOG.
