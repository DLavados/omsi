Still under development.  Only AutoGradeOMSI.R working.  See comments at
the head of the file for directions on use.

If you put the wrong suffix on answer files, here is an example of a
script to rename them:

f <- function()
{
   for (d in list.dirs()[-1]) {  # student files are subdirectories
      print(d)
      setwd(d)
      try(system('mv omsi_answer3.R omsi_answer3.txt'))
      setwd('..')
   }
}
